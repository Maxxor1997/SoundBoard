This mobile app features both a synth sequencer and a percussion sequencer. The X-axis and Y-axis tilts control the tempo of each of these sequencers respectively, and there is an added functionality that if the tempos sync, the camera flash will also go off in tempo. 

The front end is made with MobMuPlat, and the back end is made with PureData.
